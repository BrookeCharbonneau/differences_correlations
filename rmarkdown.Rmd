# Comparing rating-complaint to rating-critical correlations

The correlation between ratings and complaints and ratings and critical was *r* = .67, 95% CI [.32,1.00], *N* = 30. However, the CI is quite long, and is consistent with anywhere from a medium positive to a very strong positive relationship.

# Comparing rating-complaint to raises-critical correlations


The correlation between ratings and complaints and raises and critical was *r* = .45, 95% CI [.14,.81], *N* = 30. However, the CI is quite long, and is consistent with anywhere from a weak positive to a very strong positive relationship.

#Replication of rating-privileges correlation 


Interpretation:
The original study found a correlation of *r* = .43, 95% PI[0.05, 0.74], *N* = 30. This means that if the replication correlation differs from the original correlation only due to sampling error, there is a 95% chance the replication result will fall in this interval with a replication sample size of *N* = 100. If the replication correlation falls outside of this range, factors beyond sampling error are likely also responsible for the difference.

#Replication of rating-privileges correlation 

Cannot do it - width maxes out at 1000. If original had small n and replication study has large n, but the original study had a narrow PI and the replication r does not with within this PI, it still not very meaningful as the replication study may be more valid than the original one.
Also, small sample size - not possible to do this.

#Comparing two correlations of rating-privileges


The correlation between orginal and replication studies on the correlation of ratings and privileges was *r* = .33, 95% CI [-.02,.59], *N* = 30. However, the CI is quite long, and likely indicates a positive relationship.
